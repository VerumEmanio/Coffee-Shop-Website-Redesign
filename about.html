            <h2>About Beans N' Cream</h2>
            <p>In the fall of 1997, Beans N' Cream opened up next to a florist shop. Our first move came in 2000, when Paul and Diane Cope decided that more room was needed. So we moved our humble coffee shop into a building that at one time was the only bakery in town. In 2008, an opportunity to move once again presented itself, this time into the redone 1920's Exchange Bank. This beautiful building still features original marbling, woodwork, and stained glass windows. Come pay us a visit and become a part of our exciting story!</p>
