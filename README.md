# Coffee-Shop-Website-Redesign
## Background
This [coffee shop site](https://verumemanio.github.io/Coffee-Shop-Website-Redesign/) was a project I created as part of a web design class at my alma mater. After creating a wireframe, selecting a palette, and  accounting for user experience principles, I wrote the HTML and CSS from scratch. The site is fully responsive (i.e., the site will adjust to fit the display of your device).
