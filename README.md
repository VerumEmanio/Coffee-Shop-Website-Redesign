# Coffee-Shop-Website-Redesign
Redesign of the Beans and Cream coffee shop website

This site was a project I created for a web design class at Cedarville University. After creating a wireframe, selecting a palette, and 
accounting for user experience principles, I wrote the HTML and CSS from scratch. The site is fully responsive (i.e., the site will adjust
to fit the display of your device).

I'm in the processing of incorporating JavaScript functionality as I learn that language.
